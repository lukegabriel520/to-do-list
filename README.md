To-Do-List Application

--A simple React-based productive application that works on your to-do-list tasks. 

This To-Do List app is a simple tool built using React. It lets users easily add tasks to a list by typing in a task and clicking the "Add" button. Each task can be marked as complete by clicking a checkbox, which strikes through the task to show it's done. If a task is no longer needed, users can delete it with the "Delete" button.

The app also has a real-time clock that shows the current time and updates every second. If you enter long task names, they will scroll horizontally so you can still see the entire title. Plus, if there are too many tasks, the list will scroll vertically to make sure all tasks are visible.
